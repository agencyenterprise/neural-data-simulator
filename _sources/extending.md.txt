# Extending NDS

NDS can be extended to create a full closed-loop BCI system.
We provide framework components and example implementations for experimental tasks, decoders, and visualizations.
Additionally, we demonstrate how to use the plugin system to extend the core functionality of NDS, such as creating a new encoder or pre/postprocessor.

The figure below illustrates, in green, additional extensions that are provided with NDS to enable you to build a full closed-loop BCI system.
